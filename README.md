Portfolio Description:

Welcome to my portfolio! I’m a passionate product designer transitioning into the exciting world of back-end development. With a strong foundation in creating intuitive and user-centered designs, I’ve always been driven by the desire to not only craft seamless user experiences but to also understand the technology that powers them.

As I delve deeper into back-end development, I’m combining my design expertise with the technical skills of server-side programming, databases, and API integration. I am learning how to build the behind-the-scenes systems that support beautiful, functional user interfaces and make applications run smoothly and securely.

In this portfolio, you’ll find a mix of my design work and back-end projects—showcasing how I’m merging my understanding of user needs with my growing proficiency in technologies like Python, Node.js, SQL, and cloud services. My goal is to create not just great designs but scalable, efficient back-end systems that bring these designs to life.

I’m excited about the journey ahead and eager to apply both my design thinking and technical skills in building holistic, user-centered applications. Whether you're here to see my design work or my evolving back-end projects, I hope it demonstrates my commitment to continuous learning and creating impactful digital products from end to end.
